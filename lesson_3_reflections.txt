Question:
- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?

Answer:
- To make my files available to other contributors
- To make my files available for myself from other machines
- Have a back up version of my files

Question:
- Why might you want to always pull changes maually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
- To maintain better control of the repository contents;
- For the work not to be overlapped between different contributors;

Question:
- Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Answer:
- Fork is used when it's not possible to contribute directly to the original
project
- Clone is used every time a project needs to be duplicated on a local repository.
I guess GitHub's 'fork' functionality relies on 'clone' command itself.
- Branches are useful when a new experimental feature needs to be added/tested
without messing up the original functional project.

Question:
- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Answer:
- So that your work can be up-to-date with the work of your collaborators.
