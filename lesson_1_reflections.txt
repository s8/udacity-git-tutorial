Question:
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Question:
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?

+ clean commit structure
+ every commit is a discrete logical step
+ it's a __commit__

- with lack of habit / discipline - commits might be scarce

Question:
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

due to the nature of text documents they deal with

Question:
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log gives you a complete overview of all the commits and diff allows you to use
commit id's to track exact changes to the files

Question:
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

well, quite a bit more comfortable

Question:
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
